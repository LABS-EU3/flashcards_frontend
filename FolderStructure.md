src/pages are the root level components, ones which are directly mounted on level 1 routes. (Ex. if you have a route called /login that mounts a Login component, then Login.js will be present in pages directory).

src/modules handles your state (actions + reducers using ducks file structure).
src/modules/resource - please sort by resources for example
src/modules/user will have userActions.js, usersReducers.js, usersTypes

src/components have shared components, like Button, Input etc.

src/utils have utilities like your API wrapper, date utils, string utils etc. private routes etc

config is where you store your environment variables like API endpoints. Donâ€™t commit this to git.

store initializes the redux store.
